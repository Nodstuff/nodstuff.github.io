            <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                <p>The goal of space travel has always been to visit distant, foreign planets just to say that we have.
                This pursuit of something new has been the driving force behind human exploration since the beginning of
                time. Our desire to see what is over the horizon, the pursuit of something more, something better.
                During the course of history many people have driven humanity forward by using this desire, people such
                as: The Wright Brothers, Amelia Earhart, Roald Amundsen, Robert Falcon Scott and many more.
                These people were driven by a desire to explore and do more.</p>

                <p>These days there is a lot less exploration to be done here at home, so we have turned our gaze
                skywards, or rather, "spacewards". On the 20th of July 1969 man first set foot on a planet that wasn't
                    earth, Neil Armstrong became the first person in history to touch an alien world, the Moon.
                    This was a momentous occasion for the entire human race, and is a huge factor in inspiring today's
                    Space explorers, who have set their focus on another, more distant target. Mars.
                </p>

                <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they
                    set eye on the earth.</p>

                <blockquote>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty,
                    become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first
                    time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</blockquote>

                <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who
                    will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world
                    are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

                <p>In recent times the rhetoric around traveling to Mars has changed from being "pie in the sky" to
                    being very realistic and attainable, so much so that private companies are releasing plans for such
                an undertaking. One example of this is the recent announcement by SpaceX of their "I.T.S"
                    (Interplanetary Transport System) plan for getting to the red planet.
                This plan consists of a massive Interplanetary Spaceship, which is very space shuttle-esque, the ITS
                    Tanker and of course the rocket booster vehicle which will be used to get both of these massive
                    ships into orbit.
                The ITS Tanker is just that, a massive flying fuel tank which will be launched once the Interplanetary
                Spaceship is in orbit and will bring it fule to completely refule it for its journey to Mars.</p>

                <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally,
                    it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always
                    the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not
                    yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next
                    ten.</blockquote>

                <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a
                    historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human
                    development.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

                <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size
                    of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so
                    fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing
                    this has to change a man.</p>

                <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s
                    what living is all about.</span>

                <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission:
                    to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man
                    has gone before.</p>

                <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental
                    truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
